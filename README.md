Program files for the article entitled: "Data-Driven Modelling of Grid Connected Virtual Synchronous Machine Dynamics using Optimised Dynamic Mode Decomposition and SINDy"

The raw data from the simulation has been  stored in txt files for three different scenarios.

The analysis and data driven modelling has been metioned in System_Analysis_VSM.ipynb. 
Keep all the files in same folder before running the notebook file.
The analysis for pertubation of power set point variation has been metioned in System_Analysis_VSM_Pertubed.ipynb #This is later work

Install necessary libraries before running. Or create virtual envrionment with requirements.txt in conda envrionment or similar.
